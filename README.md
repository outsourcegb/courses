# Courses
A test project

Steps
- clone the repository
- bundle install
- rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
- rails s
- open http://localhost:3000

Swagger file: http://localhost:3000/api-docs/index.html

I could have added
- pagination
- more routes
- interactors (tho I am still not convinced with it)
